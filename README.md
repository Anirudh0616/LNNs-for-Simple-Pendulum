## 🚀 Concepts Used

### 1. Machine Learning Models
The `Model.py` file defines neural network architectures (likely using PyTorch).  
Concepts include:
- Feedforward layers (nn.Linear) for fully connected networks.
- Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) to introduce non-linearity.
- Loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy, etc.) for optimization.
- Optimizers (SGD, Adam) for gradient descent updates.

### 2. Training Loop
Defined in `Training.py`.  
Key concepts:
- Forward pass: Input data → model → predictions.
- Loss calculation: Compare predictions vs. ground truth.
- Backward pass: Compute gradients using backpropagation.
- Optimizer step: Update parameters to minimize loss.
- Epochs: Multiple passes over the dataset to improve learning.

### 3. Testing & Evaluation
Implemented in `Testing.py`.  
Concepts include:
- Inference mode (`torch.no_grad()`) to disable gradient calculation for efficiency.
- Metrics: Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, or domain-specific metrics.
- Generalization: Ensures models perform well on unseen data.

### 4. Simulation
Implemented in `Simulation.py`.  
Concepts:
- Applying trained models to synthetic or real-world scenarios.
- Possibly integrates with physics-based or mathematical simulations.
- Helps validate if the model captures underlying system dynamics.

### 5. Model Comparison
The `Model_Comparison.ipynb` notebook ties everything together:
- Trains multiple models.
- Evaluates performance on test sets.
- Compares metrics (loss curves, accuracy plots).
- Provides visual insights into which model is better suited.

## 📖 Usage

1. Train a Model  
   python Training.py  
   This trains the model defined in `Model.py` and saves checkpoints.  

2. Test a Model  
   python Testing.py  
   Runs evaluation on the trained model and prints metrics.  

3. Run Simulations  
   python Simulation.py  
   Uses trained models in simulation environments.  

4. Compare Models  
   jupyter notebook Model_Comparison.ipynb  
   This provides plots and comparative analysis.

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Define a new model in `Model.py`.  
2. Train using `Training.py`.  
3. Test using `Testing.py`.  
4. Run simulations with `Simulation.py`.  
5. Compare results in `Model_Comparison.ipynb`.
